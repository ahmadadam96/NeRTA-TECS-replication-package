This branch contains experimental code for simulating an [event
camera](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/research_dvs.html) using the relative positions
of the vehicle and a spherical target mesh.  We use OpenCV to display the
results of the simulation.

To get started, you will also need to clone the [dvssim](htps://github.com/simondlevy/dvssim)
repository into this folder.

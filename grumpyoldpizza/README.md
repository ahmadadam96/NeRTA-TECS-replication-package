This is a clone of Thomas "GrumpyOldPizza" Roell's 
[arduino-STM32L4](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) repository, modified
to work with the [Ladybug Flight Controller](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/flight-of-the-ladybug) board. 
Unless you are working with that specific board, you should be using the 
[current version](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) of Thomas's repository.

If you do have a Ladybug Flight Controller board, follow the directions on our 
[wiki](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/wiki) to install this modified version.
